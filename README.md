# Programs
This repo contains various things I have worked on either for work or fun. Each Project will have a dedicated readme describing its purpose. If it does not, I would not recommend using it in your project unless you really understand what it's doing. Otherwise I will have a detailed write up for its purpose and why I needed to do this. This is more of a playground for things I am trying to accomplish. Once something is working I will assign it to its own repository and remove it from this one. Programs that work may be updated however that is dependent on my available time. 

TDLR; Things in this repo might not work as expected; However, once it does work I will move it to its own repository.

### OpenCV to AVFrame VideoWriter
#### Project Folder: AV
Using FFMPEG Libav\* Libraries, I have converted a BGR24 cv::Mat to an AVFrame that can be saved to an mp4 using H.264 encoding with the libx264rgb encoder.
