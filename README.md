# Programs
This repo contains various things I have worked on either for work or fun. Each Project will have a dedicated readme describing its purpose. If it does not, I would not recommend using it in your project unless you really understand what it's doing. Otherwise I will have a detailed write up for its purpose and why I needed to do this.
