# Data Structures
These are Data Structures written in C referencing "Algorithms in C 3rd Edition" by Robert Sedwick (Parts 1 - 5)

Each subdirectory contains its own unique implementation of the directory name.

# Installation
I have created many CMakeFiles throughout but it will be build from this current directory.

To build and test all the data structures do the following:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
